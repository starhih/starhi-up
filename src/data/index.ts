        question: 'What is the difference between 20% and 40% tannin standardization?',
        answer: 'The percentage refers to the concentration of tannins in the extract. The 40% standardization provides a higher concentration of active compounds, which may be preferred for applications requiring more potent antioxidant activity. The 20% standardization is often used in formulations where a milder effect is desired or when cost considerations are important.'

        id: 4,
        question: 'Does your Amla extract contain vitamin C?',
        answer: 'While fresh Amla fruit is known for its high vitamin C content, our extraction process focuses on concentrating the tannins and polyphenols. The extract does contain some naturally occurring vitamin C, but it is not standardized for vitamin C content. The antioxidant activity comes primarily from the tannins and other polyphenolic compounds.'
